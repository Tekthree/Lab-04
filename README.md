## Feature Task


- Use good HTML structure to scaffold this site, using semantic elements where possible.
Container elements (a box outside of your content box that might contain multiple content boxes) are very useful in managing layout. You will need to think about the relationship between parent and child / descendant elements as well as the order in which you place them in the HTML. Be thoughtful about your layout strategy.

- Add a reset.css file to your project, like this one.

- Use SMACSS-style modularity to organize your CSS.

- Use Flexbox or CSS grids for styling this application. possible.

- Use relative units so the elements scale proportionally when the viewport dimensions change.

- Use at least two breakpoints and change the background colors of each box. There should be three possible views: desktop, tablet, and mobile device. You may choose the exact pixel values for each breakpoint.



## User Stories

- As a user, I want the dimensions and colors of the application to change so that I can have a unique view in desktop, mobile, and tablet viewports.
